<h1> Description: </h1>

Implementation of various algorithms and data structures using c/c++, Python from scratch. This is a learning resource
for students and professionals to improve their algorithms and data structure skills. It is also a good resource for coding interviews
as questions on these algorithms and data structures are common in these interviews.

<h1> CONTRIBUTING: </h1>

Contributions are welcome. Choose an algorithm or data structure not in the repository and subit a pull request. 

<h2> data_structures: </h2> 

This folder contains implementation of the basic data structures such as trees (BST), Linked lists, stack, queue, etc. in C/C++ and Python. 

<h2> sorting_algorithms: </h2> 

This folder contains popular sorting algorithms and their time complexities.

<h2>  graph_algorithms: </h2> 

This folder contains standard algorithms on graphs. 
here, i've used an adjacency list representation of graphs using dedfaultdict(list) in python.

<h2>  dynamic_programming: </h2> 

This folder contains common and popular dynamic programming algorithms such as knapsack, lcs, lis, kadane, etc.

<h2>  backtracking_algorithms: </h2> 

This folder contains backtracking based algorithms such as n-queens, etc.

<h2> advanced_data_structures: </h2> 

This folder contains implementations of advanced data structures such as Tries, Segment Trees, etc.

<h2> miscellaneous_algorithms: </h2> 

This folder contains miscellaneous algorithms commonly asked in coding interviews. These algorothms 
also help in competitive coding.
